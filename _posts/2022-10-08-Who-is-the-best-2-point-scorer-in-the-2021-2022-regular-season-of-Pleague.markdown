Over the past 21–22 regular season of PLG, 13 players have taken at least 200 2-point shots. This plot shows their total attempts and FG inside the arc.

During this time Sim Bhullar has attempted the most 2-pointers and without any doubt he’s converting over 50% of them, which is one reason to win the import of the year. I mean, who can stop this big fella if he has the ball in the paint?

Look closely, there’re only 3 local players who have attempted over 200 2-pointers and made over 40% of them, which are Youwei, Amigo and Jet.

Both Youwei and Amigo were in the first team of the year. With another additional award, Youwei won the rookie of the year and Amigo won the MVP of the year.

What about Jet? No award for him, but a ring.
