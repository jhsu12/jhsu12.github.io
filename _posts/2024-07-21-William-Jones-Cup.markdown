Although it was a bit tiring, experiencing training and competitions with the Chinese Taipei team was an unforgettable memory. I almost have all the tactics memorized üòÇ; I just need one more jersey to get on the court ü§£.

This was my first time as an attache, something I had never done before. Because of this, I learned a lot, and it‚Äôs a very memorable experience üèÄ.

Here‚Äôs a simple record of my daily schedule over these past few days:

7:30 AM - Wake up

7:50 AM - Slowly head down for breakfast & confirm the arrival of the driver

8:30 AM - Depart for the court to practice

8:35 AM - After arriving at the court, carry towels and water jugs to the lock room & turn on power at the association office to charge the walkie-talkies

8:40 AM - While the players are taping in the lock room, I push the ball cart onto the court and take a few shots to confirm that the hoop and ball are fine (just an excuse of shooting the ball üòÇ)

9:00 AM - Players start practice on time

9:00-9:40 AM - Tactical practice for players

9:40-10:00 AM - Shooting practice

By the way, I remember Chris asked me to help him find a ring that he left in the lock room. Sounds pretty expensive though. But, I didn't find it...

11:00 AM - 1:00 PM - Rest, exercise (sometimes), and have lunch

3:00 PM - Arrive at the court on time

3:10 PM - Arrive at the court and carry towels and water jugs

3:20 PM - Slowly enter the lock room; Our team arrives at the court really early, indirectly urging those from the previous match to leave quickly

3:30 PM - Players taping; I‚Äôll go into the lock room to see what's today pre-game meal, hoping there're leftovers üòÇ

4:00 PM - Confirm the player list with the coach

4:00-5:00 PM - Watch the game and chat with attaches

5:00 PM - Game starts

After each quarter, provide box score to the coaching staff

7:00 PM - Match ends (usually not exactly on time), inform the interviewed players to go to the press conference

7:30 PM - Escort the players to the car slowly since some have a lot of fans, and the coach might have to wait too long üòÇ

8:00 PM - Return to the hotel for dinner & shower

11:00 PM - Meeting

12:30 AM - Sleep

Fun fact: There are a total of 130 Kings logos in the warm-up area.


Thanks to the coaching staff and players for being very cooperative during the event, so there weren‚Äôt many issues to resolve. I also appreciate my fellow reception partners for encouraging and helping each other, and a big thank you to all the administrative staff for their hard work.

You can't find me though, I'm the one who took the pic. üòÇ
