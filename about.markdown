| *Me in Croatia* |

Hi everyone!

I'm Jason. I actually don't know much about myself. 

Let me list some of my hobbies so that u guys can know more ab me. Also myself haha.
- I like to build stuff 👨🏻‍💻
- I like sports 🏀 🏃 🏋️‍♂️
- I like to travel 🌎
- I like history, especially war history.


On this blog website, I'm planning to write about things that I'm interested in. 

I will write about my exchange student year in Sweden, places I went, things I did. Maybe also some sports analytics stuff, not sure btw.

Anyway, thank you for being interested in my post. Hope u have a wonderful day!
